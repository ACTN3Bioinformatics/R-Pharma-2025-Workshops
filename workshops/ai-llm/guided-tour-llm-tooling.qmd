## Workshop Content

### 1. From Prototype to Production

**The Reality Check:**

-   Why most AI prototypes fail in production
-   Common pitfalls in enterprise AI deployment
-   Testing and validation approaches for GenAI
-   Maintaining AI applications over time

### 2. Architecture Patterns

**Building Scalable AI Systems:**

``` r
# Example: MCP Server for Clinical Data
library(mcpr)

# Define a clinical data tool
clinical_server <- mcp_server() %>%
  add_tool(
    name = "query_adverse_events",
    description = "Query adverse events from clinical database",
    parameters = list(
      study_id = "string",
      severity = "string"
    ),
    handler = function(study_id, severity) {
      # Connect to database and query
      query_clinical_db(study_id, severity)
    }
  )
```

### 3. Real-World Applications

#### A. Interactive Chatbots for Clinical Study Reporting

-   Conversational interfaces for study data exploration
-   Natural language queries on CDISC datasets
-   Automated report generation from templates

#### B. SOP Management Systems

-   Document retrieval and summarization
-   Compliance checking against SOPs
-   Version control and change tracking

#### C. MCP Server Implementations

-   Reproducible analytics workflows
-   Tool registration and management
-   Cross-language interoperability (R ↔ Python)

### 4. AWS Bedrock Integration

**Enterprise LLM Deployment:**

-   Model selection and configuration
-   Security and access control
-   Cost optimization strategies
-   Monitoring and logging

``` python
# Python example: AWS Bedrock with LangChain
from langchain_aws import ChatBedrock

llm = ChatBedrock(
    model_id="anthropic.claude-3-sonnet",
    region_name="us-east-1"
)
```

### 5. GxP Compliance Strategies
