We will provide an introduction to the package and illustrate the usage by several examples. The focus of the package is on group sequential and adaptive designs with p-value combination tests, but also fixed sample designs can be considered. The software can specifically be used to assess design characteristics of popular group sequential designs. However, going beyond those, adaptive designs are a strength of rpact: Adaptive multi-armed and population enrichment designs that are based on closed combination tests can be assessed by simulation. The application of the designs for simulation, real data, and estimation is possible for continuous, binary, survival, and count data. Furthermore, we introduce ‘RPACT Cloud’, a user-friendly platform designed to simplify and enhance the process of clinical trial design and simulations for researchers and practitioners.

The workshop is led by Michael Chow, a Python developer at Posit who is a key contributor to open-source data tools, notably helping to launch the data presentation library Great Tables, and focusing on bringing efficient data analysis patterns to Python.\nWorkshop related link:\nhttps://github.com/machow/examples-great-tables-pharma\n\n\nWORKSHOP: How to use pointblank to understand, validate, and document your data\nRich Iannone\nSoftware Engineer at Posit PBC\nThis workshop will focus on the data quality and data documentation workflows that the pointblank package makes possible. We will use functions that allow us to:\n(1) quickly understand a new dataset\n(2) validate tabular data using rules that are based on our understanding of the data\n(3) fully document a table by describing its variables and other important details. The pointblank package was created to scale from small validation problems (“Let’s make certain this table fits my expectations before moving on”) to very large (“Let’s validate these 35 database tables every day and ensure data quality is maintained”) and we’ll delve into all sorts of data quality scenarios so you’ll be comfortable using this package in your organization. Data documentation is seemingly and unfortunately less common in organizations (maybe even less than the practice of data validation). We’ll learn all about how this doesn’t have to be a tedious chore. The pointblank package allows you to create informative and beautiful data documentation that will help others understand what’s in all those tables that are so vital to an organization.\nWorkshop related link:\nhttps://github.com/rich-iannone/pointblank-workshop\n\nEurope/US Session #1\n\n\n\nPractical AI for data science\nSimon Couch (Posit). Practical AI for data science\nWhile most discourse about AI focuses on glamorous, ungrounded applications, data scientists spend most of their days tackling unglamorous problems in sensitive data. Integrated thoughtfully, LLMs are quite useful in practice for all sorts of everyday data science tasks, even when restricted to secure deployments that protect proprietary information. At Posit, our work on ellmer and related R packages has focused on enabling these practical uses. This talk will outline three practical AI use-cases—structured data extraction, tool calling, and coding—and offer guidance on getting started with LLMs when your data and code is confidential.\nhttps://github.com/simonpcouch\n\nEurope/US Session #2\n\n\n\nduckplyr: Analyze large data with DuckDB and dplyr compatibility\nKirill Muller (Cynkra).\nThe duckplyr package is now stable; version 1.1.2 is on CRAN. It builds on top of DuckDB, a fast and flexible analytical engine that can work with larger-than-memory data from disk or cloud storage. All these features are available to duckplyr, with syntax and semantics much closer to R and the tidyverse. Use it to speed up existing code, to analyze Parquet or CSV files directly, or to access the plethora of exciting functionality provided by DuckDB.\n\n\nBeyond Training: Evolving Strategies to Teach and Support R Adoption in Pharma\nAlanah Jonas (GSK).\nTeaching R effectively is just the starting point for lasting adoption in pharma. At GSK, we began by developing two core R courses written in bookdown and delivered interactively, an approach that enabled high completion rates.\nRecognizing that training alone isn’t enough, we expanded support through options like self-certification, intermediate courses, and a Resource Hub. We also launched AccelerateR to provide tailored support to early adopters during their transition.\nToday, those efforts have scaled and evolved into Rburst, a cross-functional initiative designed not just to teach R, but to embed it into our ways of working across all of Biostatistics.\nThis talk will explore how our training strategy has matured into a broader support model, enabling wide-scale, integrated adoption of R in everyday work.\n\n\nValidating Shiny Apps in Regulated Environments\nPedro Silva (Jumping Rivers).\nShiny apps are increasingly used to deliver interactive tools in clinical and healthcare settings. But when these tools are used in regulated environments, validation becomes essential. How can we ensure that our Shiny apps are trustworthy, without stifling innovation?\nIn this talk we’ll explore practical approaches to validating Shiny applications in regulated contexts, drawing on principles from software engineering, quality assurance, and risk based validation. We’ll discuss key challenges like traceability, documentation, and versioning, as well as share techniques for building apps that are easier to validate from the start.\nI’ll highlight some of the tools and packages used in Jumping Rivers that can support validation workflows that satisfies both internal reviewers and external regulators, including the Litmusverse, a suite of R packages designed to assess code quality and generate validation evidence.\nBy the end of the session, you’ll understand: - Why validation is critical for Shiny apps in regulated contexts; - What elements make a Shiny app more or less validatable; - How to incorporate validation strategies into your development process.\nThis session is ideal for R users in pharma, clinical research, and healthcare who want to build confidence in their dashboards, while maintaining flexibility in how they work.\n\n\nBeyond {gtsummary}: How the {crane} Package Extends the Framework for Pharmaceutical Reporting\nDaniel Sjoberg (Genentech) and Davide Garolini (Genentech).\n{gtsummary} has become the most-used R package for clinical tables in the R ecosystem, winning awards from the American Statistical Association and Posit. Building on this foundation, we created {crane}, an open-source extension that facilitates reporting requirements in the pharmaceutical space. Because {crane} and {gtsummary} are built upon Analysis Results Datasets (ARDs), study teams can take advantage of this foundation that streamlines the QC process and allows for simple re-use of calculated results in subsequent reporting.\nIn this session we show how: (1) a vanilla {gtsummary} script instantly upgrades when {crane} is loaded; (2) ARD-based outputs make QC a straightforward operation; (3) LLMs can summarise the language-agnostic ARD results for medical writers in seconds. You’ll leave with a blueprint of how to adapt {crane} for your reporting needs or (or roll your own) and shorten table turnaround on day one.\nhttps://www.danieldsjoberg.com/RinPharma-crane-2025/\nhttps://github.com/ddsjoberg/RinPharma-crane-2025/tree/main\nhttps://github.com/cynkra/r-in-pharma-2025/\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1atV5rBLQF2vcCg2lraiutg_Xx2BOEklZzf9LJt842ig/edit?usp=sharing\n\nEurope/US Session #3\n\n\n\n{llumen}: An agentic LLM framework for biomedical documents, databases & foundation models\nSven-Eric Schelhorn (lumen).\nWe introduce {llumen}, an R package used at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany that implements an agentic framework bases on {ellmer} and enables pharmaceutical researchers to work with biomedical documents, large real-world evidence and biomarker databases, as well as with biological foundation models using large language models as orchestrators.\n{llumen} currently supports the following functionalities:\n\nLarge language models*\nRuns on standard company laptops (Windows, Linux, or macOS).\nAllows using a wide range of private (Azure), public (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock), and local (llama.cpp) LLMs.\nProvides both programmatic and fully interactive (chatbot) ways to interact with the LLM.\nSupports chain-of-thoughts, tree-of-thoughts, and ReAct reasoning strategies.\nSupports context management to maintain conversation history and state.\nText analysis*\nSupports embeddings (Azure, public, or local) using a local, high-performance vector DB (based on {ragnar}).\nImplements chunking office documents (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, RTF, PDF) into the vector DB.\nWhile reading office documents, supports extracting tables with summary data.\nEnables retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using the vector DB, either explicitly or by using a RAG tool that the LLM calls.\nEmulates the Future House’s PaperQA2 approach for summarizing and re-ranking parts of semantically related documents so that answer quality and comprehensiveness is significantly boosted.\nExtracts text from documents to fill structured templates, such as the JSON-based {llumen} Analysis Results Schema (LARS). Extracted JSONs are directly validated by the LLM using an R tool.\nSupports automatic diagram generation from texts, for instance to capture the main concepts of a paper in two or three flow charts.\nProvides advanced text preprocessing and cleaning capabilities for various document types.\nOffers customizable tokenization and text segmentation methods.\nAgentic tool use and codegen*\nAllows the LLM to search the internet via Google and access the textual content of websites in a controlled manner. Also includes specialized query tools for Pubmed, Pubchem, and Wikipedia.\nEnables the LLM agent to query Parquet files, Neo4j knowledge graphs, and GraphQL APIs using SQL, Cypher and GraphQL codegen in a secure context. The database agents are very capable and can answer complex, open-ended scientific questions using these data sources.\nEnables the LLM agent to use local foundation models, such as Google’s TxGemma model for pharmaceutical applications, for instance for predicting solubility of small molecules.\nUses multimodal LLMs to accurately diagnose cancer histopathology images with very comprehensive pathology reports that investigate architectural and cytological Features of H&E slides.\nMakes it easy to give the LLM new R tool capabilities (basically all R functions), share tools via MCP (built-in pure R MCP server), or utilize tools of external MCP server as internal tools (via a MCP tool wrapper).\nSupports dynamic tool creation and registration during runtime.\nProvides a framework for defining custom tools and integrating them seamlessly with the LLM.\n\nWe are internally using the package for the following usecases:\n\nSupported usecase*\n\n\nExtracting results of statistical analyses from office documents: The vignettes show how to configure an agentic LLM to extract chunks oftext from documents and tables, semantically query a vector store (agent-based retrieval-augmented generation, RAG), load JSON definitions, extract JSON-structured data from documents, and validate these definitions against a user-defined JSON template. {llumen} can be utilized to extract results data from a large corpus of clinical trial results files. Templates for both CDISC Analysis Result Standard (ARS) and the {llumen} Analysis Result Schema (LARS) are provided.\nQuerying tabular databases and knowledge graphs: {llumen} excels at SQL codegen, allowing users to query very large Parquet files located on the user’s device and perform complex data analyses. It also supports querying Neo4j knowledge graphs and GraphQL APIs, enabling comprehensive data exploration and analysis.\nWorking with biological foundation models: {llumen}’s ability to use local foundation models specialized for particular biological or pharmaceutical applications, such as Google’s GemmaTX, enhances agentic LLMs with specialized capabilities for tasks like predicting molecular properties or analyzing biological pathways.\nAutomated literature review and summarization: {llumen} can be used to perform comprehensive literature reviews by searching multiple databases (e.g., PubMed, OpenAlex), extracting relevant information, and generating structured summaries of findings.\nHistopathology image analysis: The package supports the use of multimodal LLMs for analyzing histopathology images, providing detailed reports on architectural and cytological features of H&E slides, which can aid in cancer diagnosis and research.\nDrug discovery and development support: By integrating various tools and databases (e.g., PubChem, TxGemma), {llumen} can assist in various stages of drug discovery, from initial compound screening to predicting drug properties and potential interactions.\nClinical trial data analysis and reporting: {llumen}’s capabilities in extracting and structuring data from various document types make it well-suited for analyzing and reporting on clinical trial data, potentially accelerating the process of deriving insights from trial results.\nBiomedical knowledge graph exploration: The package’s ability to query knowledge graphs allows researchers to explore complex relationships in biomedical data, potentially uncovering new insights or research directions.\nAutomated scientific writing assistance: {llumen} can be used to assist in scientific writing tasks, such as generating literature summaries, creating structured abstracts, or even drafting sections of scientific papers based on analyzed data and literature.\nRegulatory document preparation and analysis: The package’s capabilities in extracting and structuring information from various document types can be applied to preparing and analyzing regulatory documents in the pharmaceutical industry\n\nPresentation related link:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1g0_O_wSoeBHzeXl6DF3-NIY7gT2Bk62_/view\n\n\nBuild Model Context Protocol servers and clients in R\nJohn Coene (Opifex).\nThe mcpr package provides a comprehensive R implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized JSON-RPC 2.0 interface that enables R applications to expose computational capabilities to AI models. This package bridges the gap between R’s statistical computing environment and modern AI assistants by allowing R developers to create MCP servers that expose tools, resources, and prompts as well as client functionality to interact with existing MCP servers.\nKey features include schema-based tool definitions, multi-modal response support, and seamless integration with popular AI development environments including Claude Code, Cursor, and VS Code. This implementation democratizes AI-R integration by providing a standards-based approach to exposing R’s extensive ecosystem to conversational AI interfaces, opening new possibilities for interactive data analysis and statistical computing workflows.\n\nEurope/US Session #4\n\n\n\nMosaic: Open-Source, ARS-Driven Automation of Standard TFLs\nConor Moloney (Novartis).\nCDISC standards help streamline datasets (e.g. SDTM and ADaM), yet analysis results lack a common model. The emerging Analysis Results Standard (ARS) will help to fill this gap with machine-readable specifications. Mosaic couples ARS with an open-source stack to generate fully validated standard TFLs, fast and reproducibly.\nHow it works\nMosaic captures the Analysis Results Dataset (ARD) requirement in ARS-aligned YAML; updates and changes are made by editing this metadata, not code. After LinkML validation, a Python layer stores the YAML in a database via a SQL Alchemy ORM engine. The results-generation layer is intentionally language-agnostic . The rules that transform ADaM datasets into the ARD are expressed as metadata that can be rendered in any statistical language. Mosaic’s implementation uses R to derive the ARD.\nA React UI reads the validated ARD. Here, users have controlled customisation options. Users can preview each TFL shell in real time and export regulator-ready RTF files suitable for submission packages.\nMosaic replaces ad-hoc programming with a transparent, standards-based pipeline, accelerating TFL delivery while safeguarding traceability and regulatory compliance. This reallocates programmer effort from repetitive coding to high-value scientific review\n\n\nIntegrating Collaborative Programming with Automated Traceability and Reproducibility in Pharma\nJennifer Dusendang (Graticule Inc) and Sundeep Bath (Graticle Inc).\nIntegrating Collaborative Programming with Automated Traceability and Reproducibility in Pharma Studies and Real-World Data Projects by Adapting DevOps Best-Practices\nTo enhance integrity of research and study findings, data scientists should ensure that studies are traceable and reproducible, which involves meticulous management of datasets, tracking code changes, and robust storage of results.\nWithout infrastructure to support reproducibility efforts, documentation, dependency management, and version control processes can be manual, unreliable, and unclear. This creates problems with determining when analysis changes occurred, which version of study results were produced by which version of code, and whether all study steps are processed in proper order and appropriately documented.\nImplementing procedures and technical infrastructure helps to maintain and automate reproducibility and traceability. To ensure that code can be executed consistently across multiple compute environments, we structure analysis scripts into parameterized pipelines within an isolated Docker container environment which specifies all versions and dependencies. We integrate Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) into analysis pipelines to enable automatic rerunning of analyses following code modifications and storage of results in the cloud. Our process integrates and improves collaborative programming by providing code reviewers with the validated outputs that are produced by the code. By design, study close-out and compliance activities are incorporated within our infrastructure.\nIn this paper we will discuss how we implemented and adapted DevOps best-practices like CI/CD in a collaborative coding environment to work for epidemiological studies and real-world data projects. Although the concepts discussed are applicable to many tools, our implementation uses Git, GitHub Actions, SQL, Python, R, Docker, and AWS S3. This content is applicable for all skill levels.\nhttps://www.lexjansen.com/pharmasug/2025/OS/PharmaSUG-2025-OS-111.pdf\n\n\nTabPFN: A Deep-Learning Solution for Tabular Data\nMax Kuhn (Posit).\nThere have been numerous proposals for deep neural networks for tabular data, such as rectangular data sets (e.g., data frames). To date, none have really worked well and take far too long to train. TabPFN is a model that emulates a Bayesian approach and trains a deep learning model on a prior of simulated tabular datasets. Version 2 was released this year and offers several significant advantages, but also has one notable disadvantage. I’ll introduce this model and show an example.\nhttps://topepo.github.io/2025-r-pharma/#/title-slide\n\n\nThe LLM Lounge: Live-coding and conversation on using AI for data science\nJoe Cheng\nPosit\nEric Nantz\nEli Lilly\nThe number of workflows and tools leveraging large-language-models (LLMs) is growing exponentially across the world, and the life sciences industry is no exception. In this session, Eric Nantz takes the role of the curious and savvy data scientist as he is joined by Posit CTO Joe Cheng in a special live demonstration on using Databot to power an exploratory data science analysis. Throughout the demonstration, Joe will share the fascinating origin story of how Databot came to be, along with a deeper conversation on the recent trends and guiding principles of harnessing AI tools for data analyses and software engineering. This interactive, spontaneous format will allow the audience to submit questions and steer the direction of the session, making it a truly engaging, shared experience.\nhttps://github.com/posit-dev/querychat\n\n\nLLM-Powered {gtsummary}: QC-Ready Clinical Tables in Minutes\nDavide Garolini\nData Scientist, NEST, Roche\nHe significantly contributes to the NEST project by improving key tools like {gtsummary} and {rtables} for regulatory compliance.\nOpen-source R tooling has made table generation easy, yet interpreting the code and guaranteeing bullet-proof QC can still delay submissions. We present a workflow that fuses {gtsummary} for rapid table building with cards for “automatic” validation, topped by a fully offline, model-agnostic LLM helper. Starting on synthetic CDISC-like data, we create a standard summary table, validate it with {cards}, and ask the LLM-helper to explain each step and result and propose, if necessary, next steps—all without revealing trial data. A descriptive log is generated on the fly, combining code, QC results, and LLM explanations in one auditor-friendly document. When real data arrive, the same script reruns unchanged, delivering submission-ready tables in minutes while boosting clarity and compliance.\n\n\nPost-Approval Drug Exposure Estimation Using an R Shiny App\nFeifei Yang\nAstraZeneca\nYu Zhang\nAstraZeneca\nBackground\nRegulatory authorities require product post-marketing exposure estimates in aggregate safety reports for purposes of signal detection. The calculation of exposure estimates requires multiple data sources between sales data and aggregated de-identified patient data. Traditionally, the calculations were manually handled due to limited countries, products, and indications. With the growth of both markets and products, manual calculations are inefficient to handle the increasing volume of data and regional requests. An approach to automating the entire process has become essential.\nMethod\nR Shiny App is a web application framework that allows us to create interactive web applications for data analysis, data visualization, and interactive reports, making it easier to share data insights with others. We converted monthly patient and sales report into an app-readable format and applied an exposure estimate algorithm to perform calculations by region, product, and indication.\nResults\nThe time to generate a standard report of post-marketing exposure data for regulatory purposes has been reduced from a week to one day. The QC function of application helps check inconsistent numbers from month to month in sales and patient data. In addition to the exposure report, the visualization provided by the application shows trends in sales, patient utilization of products, and exposure by year and geographic regions. The sharing ability of the application enables other team members to generate customized report directly without any prerequisite training.\nConclusion\nThe application significantly improves the efficiency of delivering post-marketing exposure data and reduces time and resources needed for data management and QC. Accessibility to the application helps disseminate the information to a broader range of teams and functions.\n\n\nImplementing an end-to-end NCA software using Shiny\nGerardo Jose Rodriguez\nLucid Analytics\nJana Spinner\nLucid Analytics\nPharmacokinetic studies are essential yet demanding, typically relying on expensive proprietary software for Non-Compartmental Analysis (NCA). aNCA is an alternative developed collaboratively by Roche, Lucid Analytics, Appsilon, and Human Predictions. It is being developed within Pharmaverse, aiming to become a worldwide standard by utilizing open source development to make the process more efficient, economical, and transparent. The app performs an end-to-end approach, using interactive plots for data exploration, half life customization, TLGs, and report generation.aNCA is planned to be released on CRAN soon. It currently reaches 100% of testing coverage on its functions and has successfully passed internal package validations.\naNCA uses PKNCA, a widely used package that calculates over 200 PK parameters, has been tested against other industry-standard NCA software, showing differences within ±0.1% for most tested parameters.\nWe aim to present aNCA, highlight its innovative software concepts, discuss how we tackled key challenges, and showcase how open source and Shiny achieve industry-standard PK software. However, we welcome suggestions on focus areas for the R/Pharma audience.\nIf you want to know more about aNCA, feel free to follow the link to our GitHub: https://github.com/pharmaverse/aNCA\n\n\nIntegrating LLM using R Shiny for Clinical Data Review by Ensuring Data Privacy and Validity\nZhen Wu\nCIMS Global\nPeng Zhang\nCIMS Global\nThe pharmaceutical industry is shifting from traditional SAS-based workflows toward the open-source R ecosystem. R Shiny applications have become a popular solution for visualizing tables, figures, and listings. However, these applications often require a strong understanding of data structures and familiarity with interface components such as dropdowns, which may not be intuitive for clinical reviewers. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), have opened new possibilities for how users interact with clinical data. In this session, we present an innovative R Shiny application, {DataChat}, that enables users to “chat with data” through a conversational interface. Powered by the {ellmer}, {shinychat}, and {ragnar} packages, along with internal statistical tools and utilities, the app integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities tailored to the pharmaceutical domain. The solution emphasizes user-friendliness, enabling non-programmers and clinicians to explore datasets and derive insights while maintaining compliance with data privacy requirements and addressing concerns around statistical validity. This approach exemplifies the potential of AI-augmented tools to enhance clinical data review and exploration in a practical and accessible way\n\n\nR we there yet? {admiral}’s journey transitioning from active development to stability\nEdoardo Mancini\nRoche\nIf you are attending R/Pharma 2025, you probably enjoy actively contributing to open source R packages for the pharma industry. Fixing bugs, implementing new features and expanding the use-case is work that feels motivating and meaningful. However, what happens if/when your package reaches a point of stability and maturity, where the main use-case is answered and feature completeness is in sight? How can you sustain your development team’s momentum without chasing perfection, in a time where the active workload is naturally diminished?

Natural language queries are translated into structured R operations, through which users can interactively explore and visualize data, eliminating the need for manual coding.\nResults:\nThe application successfully handled unstructured user queries, generated targeted outputs, and produced customizable visualizations. Pilot deployment across infectious disease programs demonstrated faster extraction of trial insights, reduced dependency on ad-hoc programming\nsupport, and invigorates collaboration between statisticians, clinicians, and translational researchers.\nConclusions:\nEmbedding AI agents via ellmer within Shiny applications provides a scalable, user-friendly framework for accelerating exploratory analyses in vaccine development. This approach demonstrates how AI-assisted analytics can increase efficiency, strengthen cross-functional decision-making, and support broader adaptation of GenAI into clinical development workflows.\n\n\nautoslideR: Streamlining slide deck generation for clinical reporting events\nYolanda Zhou (Roche) and Joe Zhu (Roche).\nThe standard process of developing the slide deck for clinical reporting events includes manually populating numbers from static outputs and a separate QC. The process is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and error-prone. To address these issues, we created “autoslideR”, an R package to automate the slide deck generation for multiple clinical reporting events. autoslideR has successfully supported slide creation for several study endorsement meetings, IMC meetings, as well as dose escalation meetings for early development, saving teams 0.5 to 4 days for the slide deck preparation compared to the time it traditionally takes.\nThis talk explores the key features and technical advantages of autoslideR, such as supporting customized layout creations from existing templates, as well as adding placeholder slides to accelerate final slide preparation.\nhttps://pharmaverse.github.io/examples/digit_files/autoslider.html\n\n\nPutting the ‘R’ in RWD\nSachin Heerah (Pfizer) and Darren Jeng (Pfizer).\nThe Pfizer Real World Data (RWD) programming team has leveraged R and Posit services to enhance the capabilities of its programmers. We have designed an R package, Shiny apps and even a Quarto website to support all programmers with varying backgrounds, including those with only SAS experience. Our R package is designed to simplify database queries, utilize both R and SAS variable syntax, and standardize deliverables. We have leveraged Posit’s RStudio features such as code snippets to make code templates readily accessible for all users within the IDE. Code guides are also presented as snippets to allow all users to load example data and explore standard RWD programming workflows. Overall, embracing and leveraging the features available to us in R and Posit is enhancing our workflow through integrated resources and documentation.\n\n\nGenerating Synthetic Data with synthpop in R\nSophie Furlow (Abbot Diagnostics).\nThis talk will introduce synthetic data as an emerging tool for research and production. We will discuss the differences between synthetic, simulated, and resampled data and cover the current state of the art of synthetic data in healthcare, paying special attention to applications in pharma and diagnostics. We will walk through the basics of synthpop, an R package designed to generate synthetic and anonymous data at the individual level using various machine learning algorithms. Viewers will learn how to create entirely synthetic datasets with minimal statistical distortion their original data, making it suitable for software testing, data sharing, and model training. The talk will end with a demonstration of synthpop’s quality evaluation features and major caveats to consider during the generation process.\n\nEurope/US Session #7\n\n\n\nGenAI in Production - moving beyond prototypes\nDevin Pastoor\nChief Technology and Product Officer, A2-Ai\nCreation of AI applications has become increasingly commoditized through a rich ecosystem of R and python packages. However, there are significant hurdles to take a prototype application into “production” and keep it operating. Traditional testing and validation approaches do not always apply directly and the flexibility from which users can interact with the application can be much larger than a traditional application. This talk will discuss how to successfully (and unsuccessfully) develop, test, release, and maintain Generative AI based applications in GxP contexts.\n\n\nBuilding the Ultimate R AI Assistant\nPawel Rucki\nPrincipal Data Scientist, Roche\nUsing R for clinical programming can be challenging, particularly with the specialized, often internal, packages used for reporting. To tackle these issues, we built our own AI assistant.\nIn this talk, I’ll share our story of building a multi-agent R co-pilot with the LangGraph framework, including the lessons we learned and a few tricks we picked up. A key decision was giving each R package its own AI agent. This was a game-changer for getting good help on our internal packages where general-purpose LLMs just can’t keep up.\nI’ll discuss our agent network architecture and the practical techniques used to give agents the right context to write, debug, and explain complex R code for clinical trials. I’ll wrap up with a live demo showing how our design solves real-world programming problems, speeding up development and leading to better, more reliable code.\n(agents, cursor via mcp, webR extenstion, admiralroche, air AI assistant for programming in R)\n\nEurope/US Session #8\n\n\n\nThe Dependency Whisperer: AI That Sees What You Might Miss\nMing Yan\nEli Lilly\nVina Ro\nSr. Clinical Data Analyst, Eli Lilly\nAn ongoing challenge in clinical programming is ensuring that downstream analyses are accurately refreshed following updates to SDTM or ADaM datasets. Traditional tools like AstroGrep can locate references to specific datasets or variables, but they lack the ability to distinguish between active code and commented text. Moreover, identifying indirect dependencies often requires multiple searches and manual effort to document all affected areas, which is time-consuming and increases the risk of missing updates—potentially leading to incorrect outputs being shared with external parties.\nThis paper introduces an AI-powered tool designed to automatically identify and visualize all datasets and variables impacted by upstream changes. By parsing SDTM, ADaM, and TFL specifications or programs, the tool learns the structure of dependencies across the analysis pipeline. When a user specifies an updated variable and dataset, the tool generates a graphical report highlighting all affected elements. This capability streamlines the refresh process, reduces manual effort, and ensures the accuracy and completeness of deliverables.\n\n\nBayesERtools: R package for exposure-response analysis with Bayesian approaches\nKenta Yoshida\nClinical Pharmacology Modeling & Simulation, Genentech\nExposure-response (ER) analysis is a critical component of clinical drug development for decisions such as dose selection. The new R package, BayesERtools (https://genentech.github.io/BayesERtools/), is designed to make Bayesian ER analysis more accessible. It provides a user-friendly interface for common tasks such as model development, simulation, and plotting, streamlining the entire workflow. The package currently supports linear and Emax models for continuous and binary endpoints. To further support users, we have also developed BayesERbook (https://genentech.github.io/BayesERbook/), a comprehensive online book that documents the workflow with typical examples. This open-source project, based on the Stan ecosystem, aims to expand the use of Bayesian methods in pharma, providing a powerful tool for quantitative decision-making in drug development.\n\n\nAdapting to Regulatory Guidance: Covariate Adjustment and R-enabled Submissions\nAlex Przybylski\nData scientist @ Novartis\nFDA guidance released in 2023 advocates for covariate adjustment as a non-controversial means to enhance the efficiency of statistical analyses. This includes specific recommendations featuring recently proposed methods from academic groups, providing an opportunity for sponsors to realize the practical benefits of innovative approaches. However, they also present challenges for trial teams regarding practical implementation. Bridging the gap between academia, regulation and industry adoption is essential.\nThis talk presents a case study from Novartis, where FDA feedback referencing the new guidance prompted a targeted and strategic response. We will discuss how we responded to this feedback, our preparation for future regulatory expectations, and the role of R in enabling change and impact.\nThe case study will highlight lightweight R package solutions ({beeca}) and the work of the ASA-BIOP Covariate Adjustment Working Group ({RobinCar2}). We will discuss the importance of software that is suited for integration with trial analysis workflows in regulated environments and the benefits of collaborating within the open-source community.\n\n\nR library validation using Acceptance-Test Driven Development\nBrian Repko\nRetired (ex-Novartis Biomedical Research Oncology Data Science), Retired (ex-Novartis)\nEurope/US\nWhile unit tests are a key component of a single R package’s quality, we need similar ways to test / validate a library of R packages or potentially Shiny applications. This session will walk through frameworks used for Acceptance-Test Driven Development (ATDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD) outside of R - cucumber, JBehave, etc. - how they work and their value-add to system quality. In short, tests are written in Quarto markdown, in a “given-when-then” format that is regex-matched against annotated functions that drive the testing and asserting of the system under test. The industry can write tests in plain-language and share those tests and feature code not only amongst themselves but also potentially as part of a validation effort with regulators. Feature code can also make use of packages like {chromote} to drive Shiny applications as well. This is bringing my experience as a contributor to JBehave to R and the pharmaverse.\n\n\nWORKSHOP: R Validation Discussion: Metric Repos for Open Quality Assessment\nDoug Kelkhoff\nOver the past year, the R Validation Hub has been hard at work to build out a Metric Repository - a pre-built database of metrics to support the software validation process. We’d like to invite you to discuss the industry outlook for this open validation database. How do we standardize our compute environments to make metrics useful? What do we do when a package isn’t living up to our standards? What can we do to ensure that you can supplement our database with the validation of in-house packages? We’d love to share our answers and hear your thoughts to help guide our work. Come join us and discuss the future of R package validation.\nWorkshop related packages:\nriskmetric, riskassessment, riskscore\nWorkshop related links:\nhttps://github.com/pharmaR/regulatory-r-repo-wg\nhttps://github.com/pharmaR/val.meter\nhttps://github.com/pharmaR/val.criterion\n\n\nWORKSHOP: datasetjson - Read and write CDISC Dataset JSON formatted datasets in R and Python\nMichael Stackhouse Chief Innovation Officer, Atorus Sam Hume Research Data Engineer | Open Source | Data Exchange Standards, CDSIC Nick Masel Associate Director Innovation Team Lead, Johnson & Johnson Eli Miller Senior Manager, Cloud Solutions, Atorus What? Join us for an engaging workshop designed to introduce Dataset-JSON, a powerful format for sharing datasets.

By leveraging reusable algorithms, {sdtm. oak} offers a modular programming framework that can potentially automate the creation of SDTM datasets based on standard SDTM specifications. In this workshop, we will cover the fundamentals of the V0.1 {sdtm.oak} package and provide detailed guidance for programmers to begin utilizing it effectively.\nUsers will be given access to an R environment for the session. Users do not need to install R or other tools/packages prior to the session.\nWorkshop related link:\nhttps://pharmaverse.github.io/rinpharma-SDTM-workshop/#/title-slide\n\n\nWORKSHOP: Python for Clinical Study Report and Submission\nNan Xiao\nStatistician at Merck, Merck\nYilong Zhang\nBiostatistician at Meta, Meta\nOpen-source programming languages are rapidly transforming drug discovery, research, and development, offering powerful capabilities for study design, data analysis, visualization, and clinical reporting. This workshop introduces practical strategies for using Python to prepare tables, listings, and figures (TLFs) in a clinical study report (CSR) and to assemble submission-ready electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) packages that include both source code and deliverables.\nThis workshop is designed for clinical programmers, statisticians, and data scientists who are interested in exploring Python as an alternative approach for clinical trial analysis and reporting. Participants will gain hands-on experience with reproducible workflows, clinical data engineering, and end-to-end project management using the modern Python toolchain. By the end of the session, attendees will have a clear roadmap to start a Python project for clinical trial analysis and reporting.\nThe workshop is based on the open source book Python for Clinical Study Reports and Submission (https://pycsr.org/) and is organized into four modules:\n\nPython environment setup: Use uv to create and manage reproducible Python projects. Develop and collaborate in GitHub Codespaces, Visual Studio Code, or Positron.\nPython packages for clinical reporting: A guided tour of essential packages such as polars, plotnine, and rtflite, with demonstrations of creating TLFs commonly used in clinical trials.\nManage a clinical trial A&R project: Practical project structure, conventions, and execution from data to deliverables.\nPreparing eCTD submission packages: An example workflow for assembling submission-ready source code and outputs using py-pkglite, aligned with eCTD requirements.\n\nhttps://pycsr.org/slides/workshop-slides.html#/datasets\nPublicly available CDISC pilot study data located at the CDISC GitHub repository.\nThe dataset structure follows the CDISC Analysis Data Model (ADAM).\nSource data: https://github.com/elong0527/r4csr/tree/main/data-adam\nConverted parquet data: https://github.com/nanxstats/pycsr/tree/main/data\nWorkshop Slides:\nhttps://pycsr.org/slides/workshop-slides.html#\nhttps://github.com/nanxstats/pycsr\n\n\nWORKSHOP: Supercharge your shiny app by offloading computations to a HPC cluster\nMichael Mayer\nPrincipal Solution Engineer at Posit , Posit PBC\nWith ever increasing complexity of data and analysis, application developers are tempted to put in serious computations into their shiny applications. Given that those shiny applications typically run on infrastructure that has certain resource limitations or sometimes even shared with other shiny apps, more often than not this leads to crashes affecting the overall stability of the system. As a consequence, either other approaches are pursued, or the approach simplified to the point that good science is prevented from happening. in this workshop you will learn how to interact with a remote HPC cluster straight from your laptop. You will run a shiny app locally and remote submit pieces of code to the HPC cluster. By leveraging a multiple of your locally available compute power for a short period of time, you will reduce  time-to-result considerably keeping the app fairly interactive. This approach also can be used to connect applications hosted on a Shiny Hosting platform such as Posit Connect to a HPC cluster. In the second part of the workshop you will be able to discuss with the workshop instructor(s) your own use cases and get insights on how to address those.\n\n\nWORKSHOP: Bayesian Survival and Multistate Models using R and Stan\nEric Novik\nFounder & CEO @ Generable, Generable\nJacqueline Buros-Novik\nGenerable\nJuho Timonen\nComputational Scientist, Generable\nBayesian inference and Stan offer many advantages for analyzing time-to-event data, including incorporating prior knowledge into the model, propagating all sources of uncertainty to produce well-calibrated predictions, and integrating arbitrary utility functions for optimal decision-making, such as patients’ preferences for different types of risks. The latter point is particularly relevant in multistate models where people may differ in their preferences towards multiple competing events.In this workshop, we will briefly introduce Bayesian workflow – the typical steps in Bayesian analysis and basic (single-event) survival models in the Bayesian context. We will then proceed to introduce multistate models where we are tracking multiple event types, such as bleeding and stroke in cardiovascular trials, or stable disease, progressive disease, and death in oncology trials. Time permitting, we will demonstrate how to incorporate the patient’s utility function into a decision analysis.\nWorkshop related link:\nhttps://github.com/generable/bmstate\n\n\nWORKSHOP: From Data to Insights: A Hands-On Workshop with {teal} for Clinical Data Exploration\nNina Qi\nPrincipal Data Scientist at Genentech, Roche/Genentech\nDony Unardi\nData Scientist at Genentech, Roche/Genentech\n{teal} is an innovative open-source R-Shiny framework that has transformed how clinical trial data is analyzed and visualized in recent years.
